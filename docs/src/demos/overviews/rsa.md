## Overview

This demo demonstrates Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) for analyzing neural representational geometries.

### What is RSA?

RSA quantifies how neural patterns represent different stimuli/conditions:
1. **Compute dissimilarity**: Calculate distance between conditions (e.g., correlation distance)
2. **Create RDM**: Representational Dissimilarity Matrix showing all pairwise distances
3. **Compare geometries**: Relate neural RDMs to behavior, models, or other brain regions

### RSA Workflow

1. **Extract patterns**: Get spatial or spatiotemporal patterns for each condition
2. **Compute RDM**: Calculate dissimilarity between all condition pairs
3. **Statistical testing**: Assess significance of representational structure
4. **Model comparison**: Compare neural RDMs to theoretical predictions

### Applications

- Compare representational geometry across time
- Test computational models of cognition
- Relate neural to behavioral similarity
- Cross-modality comparisons

### Advantages

- Multivariate (uses all channels)
- Model-agnostic representational space
- Can compare across different measurement modalities

## Overview

This demo shows how to extract quantitative measurements from ERP waveforms.

### ERP Measurements

Extract meaningful features from averaged waveforms:

**Amplitude Measures:**
- **Mean amplitude**: Average voltage in a time window
- **Peak amplitude**: Maximum/minimum voltage
- **Peak-to-peak**: Voltage difference between peaks

**Latency Measures:**
- **Peak latency**: Time of maximum deflection
- **Onset latency**: When component begins
- **Fractional area latency**: Time point dividing area

**Area Measures:**
- **Integral**: Total area under the curve
- **Rectified area**: Absolute area (ignores polarity)

### Use Cases

- Quantify component amplitudes (N1, P3, N400, etc.)
- Compare experimental conditions statistically
- Report ERP characteristics in publications

## Overview

This demo demonstrates visualization of electrode layout configurations.

### Layout Visualization

Display electrode positions in 2D and 3D:
- **2D topographic projection**: Standard head view from above
- **3D spherical coordinates**: Full spatial arrangement
- **Neighbor connections**: Show spatial relationships

### Use Cases

- Verify electrode montage is correct
- Document electrode positions for publications
- Understand spatial sampling for interpolation
- Plan analysis strategies based on coverage

### Layout Types

Available layouts for common EEG systems:
- BioSemi (16, 32, 64, 128 channels)
- BrainProducts actiCap
- EasyCap
- Custom montages

## Overview

This demo demonstrates plotting event-related potentials with various customization options.

### ERP Plotting

Visualize averaged waveforms across conditions:
- **Multiple conditions**: Overlay for comparison
- **Channel selection**: Plot specific electrodes or regions
- **Customization**: Colors, line styles, confidence intervals

### Plot Features

- Time on x-axis, amplitude on y-axis
- Condition overlays with labels
- Shaded confidence intervals (optional)
- Time markers for stimulus onset, analysis windows
- Topographic insets at specific time points

### Applications

- Publication-quality figures
- Compare experimental conditions
- Identify and measure ERP components

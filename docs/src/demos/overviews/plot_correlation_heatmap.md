## Overview

This demo demonstrates visualization of channel correlation matrices.

### Channel Correlation

Correlation heatmaps show relationships between all channel pairs:
- **Good data**: Nearby channels show high correlation
- **Bad channels**: Low correlation with neighbors (bridged or poor contact)
- **Global patterns**: Identify systematic artifacts

### Interpretation

- High correlation with neighbors: Expected for clean data
- Isolated low correlation: Potential bad channel
- Unexpected high correlation: Possible electrode bridging

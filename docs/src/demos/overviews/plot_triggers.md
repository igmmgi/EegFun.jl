## Overview

This demo demonstrates visualization of event markers and triggers in continuous data.

### Trigger Visualization

Display when experimental events occurred:
- **Trigger markers**: Vertical lines at event times
- **Trigger codes**: Different colors/styles for different event types
- **Timing validation**: Verify event sequences and ISIs

### Use Cases

- **Quality control**: Verify triggers were recorded correctly
- **Timing analysis**: Check inter-stimulus intervals
- **Event sequence**: Confirm experimental protocol
- **Troubleshooting**: Identify missing or spurious triggers

### Features

- Overlay on continuous data
- Color-coded by trigger type
- Zoom to inspect timing precision
- Summary statistics of trigger counts

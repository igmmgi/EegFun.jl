## Overview

This demo shows how to visualize individual epochs with channel selection.

### Epoch Visualization

Display single-trial waveforms across channels:
- **Multi-channel view**: See all electrodes simultaneously
- **Time-locked to events**: Aligned to stimulus/response
- **Channel selection**: Focus on regions of interest

### Use Cases

- Inspect trial-level variability
- Verify epoching parameters
- Identify trial-specific artifacts
- Explore condition differences at single-trial level

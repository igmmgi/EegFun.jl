## Overview

This demo shows how to visualize channel joint probability distributions for quality assessment.

### Joint Probability Analysis

Joint probability detects outlier channels based on multi-dimensional distributions:
- Compares each channel to all others simultaneously
- More sensitive than univariate metrics
- Identifies channels with unusual data characteristics

### Visualization

Plot shows how each channel relates to the overall distribution:
- **Low probability**: Potential bad channels
- **Consistent probabilities**: Clean data
- **Spatial patterns**: Systematic issues with recording

### Use Cases

- Automated bad channel detection
- Complement other quality metrics
- Pre-processing quality control

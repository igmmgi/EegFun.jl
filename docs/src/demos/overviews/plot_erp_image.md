## Overview

This demo shows how to create ERP image plots for visualizing trial-by-trial variations.

### ERP Images

ERP images display single-trial data as 2D color-coded images:
- **Rows**: Individual trials
- **Columns**: Time points
- **Color**: Amplitude
- **Sorting**: Trials can be sorted by RT, amplitude, or other variables

### Why Use ERP Images?

- **Visualize variability**: See trial-to-trial differences beyond the average
- **Identify artifacts**: Spot trials with transient noise
- **Phase consistency**: Observe whether components are time-locked vs. phase-locked
- **Sorting effects**: Reveal dynamics related to behavior or stimulus properties

### Applications

- Supplement traditional ERPs with single-trial information
- Identify outlier trials
- Explore relationships between neural activity and behavior

## Overview

This demo shows how to visualize detected artifacts in epoched data.

### Artifact Visualization

Visualize which channels and epochs contain artifacts:
- **Channel-wise**: See which electrodes are most affected
- **Epoch-wise**: Identify problematic trials
- **Temporal patterns**: When artifacts occur within epochs

### Plot Components

- Individual epoch waveforms with artifact markers
- Bad channel/epoch summaries
- Rejection statistics across conditions

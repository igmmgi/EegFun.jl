## Overview

This demo demonstrates visualization of filter frequency and phase responses.

### Filter Response Plots

Inspect filter characteristics before applying:
- **Magnitude response**: How much each frequency is attenuated
- **Phase response**: Time delays introduced at different frequencies
- **Impulse response**: Filter behavior in time domain

### Why Visualize Filters?

- Verify cutoff frequencies are correct
- Check transition band steepness
- Identify potential artifacts (ringing, phase distortion)
- Document filter parameters for methods sections

### Filter Types

- **High-pass**: Remove slow drifts
- **Low-pass**: Remove high-frequency noise
- **Band-pass**: Isolate specific frequencies
- **Notch**: Remove line noise (50/60 Hz)

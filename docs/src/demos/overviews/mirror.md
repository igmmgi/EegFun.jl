## Overview

This demo shows how to mirror electrode positions for lateralized analyses.

### What is Electrode Mirroring?

Mirroring creates left-right symmetric electrode pairs for hemispheric comparisons:
- Useful for laterality analyses (left vs. right hemisphere processing)
- Enables averaging across hemispheres
- Important for language, spatial attention, and motor studies

### Use Cases

- **Hemispheric asymmetry**: Compare left vs. right processing
- **Averaged lateralized components**: Combine left and right activity
- **Electrode matching**: Ensure symmetric montage coverage

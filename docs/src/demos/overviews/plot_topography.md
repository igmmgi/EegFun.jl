## Overview

This demo shows how to create topographic scalp maps at specific time points.

### Topographic Maps

Visualize spatial distribution of activity across the scalp:
- **Color-coded**: Amplitude represented by color
- **Interpolated**: Smooth maps between electrode positions
- **Time-specific**: Snapshot at particular latency

### Interpretation

- **Focal activity**: Localized color patches suggest specific sources
- **Widespread**: Diffuse patterns suggest distributed processing
- **Polarity**: Red (positive) vs. blue (negative) conventions

### Use Cases

- Visualize ERP component topographies
- Compare spatial distributions across conditions
- Identify sources (with caution - inverse problem)
- Publication figures

### Advanced Options

- Multiple time points in sequence
- Difference topographies (condition A - B)
- Statistical masking
- Contour lines

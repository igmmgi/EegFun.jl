- statistics.jl
  - internal functions with _ underscore
  - code volume!

- mirror.jl 
  - add additional option for amount of mirroring

- lrp.jl 
  - needs actual testing with proper dataset
  - examples need updating

- gfp.jl
  - needs more testing
  - examples need updating
  - code repetition

- erp_measurments.jl 
  - testting!!!
  - erp plot displays
  - integration with AnovaFun

- more consistent plot_decoding with rest of plotting code base
- decoding statistics and permutation stats: overlap? reduce repetition?

Do we use minimal_error? Make it just minimal_error_throw, or combine with minimal_stacktrace

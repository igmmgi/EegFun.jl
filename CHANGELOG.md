## [Unreleased]

## [0.5.0] - 2026-07-16

### Added

- zero-allocation virtual padding in time-frequency pipelines (`tf_morlet`, `tf_stft`, `tf_multitaper`) to reduce memory usage and improve speed.

### Changed

- `resample` API has transitioned to using an explicit `target_rate` argument (e.g., target sample rate in Hz) instead of a downsampling `factor`.

### Deprecated

### Removed

- Removed old `factor`-based resampling logic and corresponding test validations.

### Fixed

- Fixed metadata preservation (`:time` and `condition` columns) edge cases during Time-Frequency data extraction.
